    "description": "Spotting growth is a marketing guru's personal website. I got hired to redesign the website and give the brand a fresh and creative look. My client already had a website that she was not happy with and wanted to bring me on board to help with the redesign. \n\nSome of the client's requirements included: \n- She wanted to incorporate 3D visuals and icons into her website \n- She wanted the website to be an even balance between corporate and fun \n- She wanted better styling of specific cards on the website, like the services card \n\nKeeping all requirements in mind I sucessfully designed a website my client was happy with and launched the redesigned website for her 1 year anniversary",

    "description": "For this project, I got hired to design a tourism website template for Divi, which is a WordPress plugin. My client gave me creative freedom with some limitations I had to consider. \n\nMy client requested website designs that are unique but simple enough to transfer to Divi. They also asked for a simple calendar layout that will immediately inform users of the date, time, event, and location. \n\nAs a designer, it is essential to know how to work around limitations like steering clear of section layouts that are hard to translate into page builders. I designed each section carefully, making it creative and stylish while keeping it simple enough to transfer to Divi.",

Chow chooses a random eatery nearby the user's current location. \n\nWe aimed to make the app fun, fresh and simple to use. Users can operate the app, both with and without signing up with us, making it accessible to everyone. Initially, we only wanted to add restaurants in the search results but, we decided to expand the search across more categories like cafes, bakeries, bars, etc. Why? We thought, if we were to use an app like Chow, we'd want to be able to search more than just restaurants. \n\nChow is an app that enables users to explore restaurants they wouldn't usually try, which could help generate traffic to more obscure local restaurants, which, I hope, can help to enrich local communities.",
